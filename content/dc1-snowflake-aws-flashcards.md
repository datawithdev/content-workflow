In this inaugural issue we will cover Snowflake, cloud computing flash cards, and books and resources about data science.

Snowflake is hot and for good reasons. It is the first major relational database that is targeting some of the toughest challenges of data professionals: data sharing, collaboration, and analytics. There have been many solutions to address each of the these challenges using separate tools. None of the database systems, however, have been built from the ground up to address these issues in a cloud-native way. Their vision and technical prowess is combined with Snowflake's aggressive focus on sales and marketing. In our latest article, I aim to answer these questions in a multiple parts. First in the series is the foundation.

Where does Snowflake fit into modern data stack?

What pain-points does Snowflake solve?

**Data Engineering**

Number of different ways you can cook an egg and database scaling strategies have a linear relationship. Here is [an approach Slack took](https://slack.engineering/scaling-datastores-at-slack-with-vitess/) to scale MySQL using Vitess. [Vitess](https://vitess.io/) a horizontal clustering solution for MySQL.

Database administration is fast becoming a hard-to-find skill because of cloud adoption. Peter Strubny ([@stribny](https://twitter.com/stribny)) has [some good pointers](https://stribny.name/blog/2020/07/scaling-relational-sql-databases/) on performance tuning and scaling relational databases.

**The cloud**

If you are a beginner, cloud certifications is a great way to learn today's in-demand skills. What could be better than learning it cloudbite by bite. [CloudBite](https://cloudbite.attejuvonen.fi/) is an open-source application to create flash cards.

**Data Science**

If you analyze data using Excel or Tableau, is that considered data science or analysis? Ben Sullins ([@BenSullins](https://twitter.com/BenSullins)) does a great job explaining the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL4b0RnLq-s).
